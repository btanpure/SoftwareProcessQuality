Feature: Rain Check
  I want to use this template to check if it will rain or not


  Scenario: Check for case A
    Given the temp is more than 20f degree Celcius
    And the wind speed is more than 5f kmph
    When the pressure is 23 inHg
    Then I validate that outcome is "No Rain".


  Scenario Outline: Check for case A
    Given the temp is more less 20f degree Celcius
    And the wind speed is 9 kmph
    Then I verify that pressure does not matter in step
		And I validate that the outcome is "Rain".
	
  ##  Examples: 
  ##    | name  | value | status  |
  ##    | temp |     22 | success |
  ##   | name2 |     7 | Fail    |
