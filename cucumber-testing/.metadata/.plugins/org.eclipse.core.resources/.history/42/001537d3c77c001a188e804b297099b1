Feature: Rain Check
  I want to use this template to check if it will rain or not


  Scenario: Check for case A
    Given the temp is 22.0 degree Celcius
    And the wind speed is 5.0 kmph
    When the pressure is 30.0 inHg
    Then I validate that result is "Rain"

  Scenario: Check for case B
    Given it is 18.0 temp
    And the wind speed is 9.0 kmph
    When the pressure is 25.0 inHg
    Then I validate that result is "Rain"
