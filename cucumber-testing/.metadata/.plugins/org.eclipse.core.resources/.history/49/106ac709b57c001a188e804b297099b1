Feature: Rain Check
  I want to use this template to check if it will rain or not

  Scenario: Check for case A
    Given the temp is more than 20 degree Celcius
    And the wind speed is more than 5 kmph
    When the pressure is 23 inHg
    Then I validate that outcome is No Rain.

    Given the temp is more less 20 degree Celcius
    And the wind speed is 9
    When I check for the <value> in step
    Then I verify the <status> in step

    Examples: 
      | name  | value | status  |
      | name1 |     5 | success |
